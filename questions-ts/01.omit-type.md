# For what is "Omit" type needed?

## Answer
This is a type inside of what you can set a properties that will be excluded from parental type.

```typescript
type Person = { name: string; age: number; location: string; };
type QuantumPerson = Omit<Person, 'location'>;
QuantumPerson = { name: string; age: number; };
```
