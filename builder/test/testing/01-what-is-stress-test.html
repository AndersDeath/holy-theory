<p>In software engineering, a stress test refers to a type of performance testing that evaluates the behavior and stability of a software system under extreme or stressful conditions. The purpose of a stress test is to assess the system&#39;s ability to handle high loads, heavy traffic, or resource-intensive scenarios.</p>
<p>During a stress test, the software system is intentionally pushed to its limits to observe how it performs under extreme conditions. The test focuses on identifying performance bottlenecks, uncovering weaknesses, and validating the system&#39;s response and recovery capabilities when subjected to stress factors such as high user concurrency, large data volumes, or excessive processing demands.</p>
<p>The stress test simulates conditions that go beyond the typical usage patterns and aims to answer questions like:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does the system behave when a significantly higher number of users access it simultaneously?</li>
<li>Does the system respond within acceptable time frames under high load?</li>
<li>Does the system handle sudden spikes in traffic without crashing or experiencing performance degradation?</li>
<li>Can the system recover gracefully from resource exhaustion or failures?</li>
</ol>
<p>By conducting stress tests, software engineers can proactively identify and address performance issues, scalability limitations, and architectural flaws before they impact the system&#39;s stability, user experience, or overall business operations. The insights gained from stress testing can inform optimization efforts, capacity planning, and infrastructure adjustments to ensure the software system meets performance requirements and can withstand stressful conditions in production environments.</p>
