# Identical twins
```java
class Solution {
	int getIdenticalTwinsCount (int[] arr) {
		HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			Integer val = map.get(arr[i]);
			if(val == null) {
				map.put(arr[i],1);
			} else {
				map.put(arr[i], ++val);
			}
		}
				
		int count = 0;
		for(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> y: map.entrySet()){
			int x = (y.getValue() * (y.getValue() - 1)) / 2;
			count += x;
			
		}
		return count;
	}
}
```

The code is a Java implementation of a function to count the number of identical twins in an array of integers. Identical twins are pairs of elements in the array that have the same value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `getIdenticalTwinsCount` function takes an integer array `arr` as input and returns the count of identical twins in the array.

2. A `HashMap` named `map` is created to store the frequency of each element in the array. The key represents the element value, and the value represents its frequency.

3. The function iterates through the array using a for loop. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if the element is already present in the `map`. If the element is not present (i.e., `val` is null), it adds the element to the `map` with a frequency of 1. If the element is already present, it increments the frequency by 1.

4. After counting the frequencies of all elements in the array, the function proceeds to calculate the count of identical twins.

5. It initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will store the final count of identical twins.

6. The function then iterates through the entries of the `map` using a for-each loop. For each entry `y` in the `map`, it calculates the count of identical twins for the specific element value.

7. The count of identical twins for a specific element value is calculated as `x = (y.getValue() * (y.getValue() - 1)) / 2`. This formula computes the number of combinations of 2 elements with the same value, which represents the count of identical twins for that value.

8. The calculated `x` is added to the `count`, accumulating the total count of identical twins for all element values.

9. Finally, the function returns the total count of identical twins.

Techniques used in this code include:
- Using a `HashMap` to count the frequencies of elements in the array.
- Iterating through the array and updating the frequency counts in the `HashMap`.
- Iterating through the `HashMap` entries to calculate the count of identical twins for each element value.
- Mathematical computation to calculate the count of identical twins using combinations.
