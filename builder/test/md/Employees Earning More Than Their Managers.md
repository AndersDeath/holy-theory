# Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

```sql
SELECT a.Name AS Employee
FROM Employee a, Employee b
WHERE a.ManagerId = b.Id AND a.Salary > b.Salary
```

**Solution:**

Step-by-step breakdown of the query:

1. `SELECT a.Name AS Employee`: This part of the query selects the `Name` column from the `Employee` table and aliases it as `Employee`.

2. `FROM Employee a, Employee b`: This part of the query specifies the source table, which is `Employee`, and aliases it as `a` and `b`. The query performs a self-join on the `Employee` table by referencing it twice with different aliases (`a` and `b`).

3. `WHERE a.ManagerId = b.Id AND a.Salary > b.Salary`: This part of the query specifies the condition for the self-join. It selects only those rows where the `ManagerId` of an employee (`a`) matches the `Id` of another employee (`b`), and the salary of the employee (`a`) is greater than the salary of their respective manager (`b`). This effectively retrieves employees who have higher salaries than their managers.

4. The query execution returns the `Name` values of employees who meet the condition of having higher salaries than their managers.

Techniques used:

1. SQL Query Language: The code uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database. SQL is a standard language used for querying and manipulating relational databases.

2. SELECT Statement: The query uses the `SELECT` statement to specify the column to be retrieved from the database and aliases the result column as `Employee`.

3. Self-Join: The query performs a self-join on the `Employee` table by referencing it twice with different aliases (`a` and `b`). This allows the query to compare employees with their respective managers.

4. WHERE Clause: The query uses the `WHERE` clause to specify the condition for the self-join, filtering the rows based on the specified criteria (salary comparison between employees and their managers).

Summary:

The provided SQL query retrieves the `Name` values of employees who have higher salaries than their respective managers by performing a self-join on the `Employee` table based on the `ManagerId` and `Salary` columns.
