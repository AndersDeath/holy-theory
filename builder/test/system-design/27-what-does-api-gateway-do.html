<p>API Gateway serves as a centralized entry point for client applications to access multiple backend APIs. It offers several key functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing</strong>: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate backend service/API based on the requested resource path or other routing rules.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Validates and authorizes client requests using various authentication mechanisms such as API keys, JWT tokens, or other credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Determines if a client has permission to access a specific resource or perform a certain action.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Controls the number of requests allowed from a client within a certain timeframe, preventing abuse or excessive usage.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong>: Stores frequently accessed API responses to reduce backend load and improve response times.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong>: Modifies request/response payloads to match the requirements of backend services or client applications.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Tracks and logs API usage and performance metrics to monitor overall health and identify potential issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples to illustrate these functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing</strong>: An API Gateway receives an HTTP request and routes it to the appropriate backend service based on the requested resource path.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: An API Gateway verifies the identity of a client by validating API keys, JWT tokens, or other authentication credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization</strong>: An API Gateway checks if a client has the necessary permissions to access a specific API endpoint or perform a particular action.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: An API Gateway restricts the number of requests a client can make within a given time period (e.g., 100 requests per minute).</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong>: An API Gateway caches the response from a backend API and serves it directly to future identical requests, reducing backend load.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong>: An API Gateway modifies the request or response payloads to match the format required by the backend service or client application.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: An API Gateway tracks API usage metrics such as request count, latency, and error rates to monitor performance and health.</li>
</ul>
