# What is functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. This approach emphasizes immutability, purity, and higher-order functions.

Here are some key concepts in functional programming:

1. **Pure Functions:** Pure functions are functions where the output value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This means if you call a function with the same arguments, it will always return the same result.

2. **Immutability:** In functional programming, data is immutable, which means once it is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing data, functional programs create new data.

3. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions:** Functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

4. **Referential Transparency:** An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This is closely related to the concept of pure functions.

5. **Recursion:** Functional programming languages often rely heavily on recursion instead of loops for repetitive tasks.

6. **Lazy Evaluation:** Lazy evaluation delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This can help improve performance and allows for the creation of potentially infinite data structures.

Popular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, F#, and Scala. However, many other programming languages, like JavaScript, Python, and Java, also support functional programming paradigms to varying degrees, allowing developers to use functional programming concepts alongside other programming styles.
