## CDN Workflow

![CDN Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersDeath/holy-theory/main/images/10-cdn-workflow.png)

A **CDN (Content Delivery Network) workflow** is a series of steps that govern how content (such as images, videos, scripts, and stylesheets) is distributed from the origin server to end users via a network of geographically distributed servers. CDNs are essential for improving the speed, reliability, and scalability of content delivery on the internet by serving cached content from the server closest to the user.

Here’s a breakdown of the CDN workflow:

### 1. **Content Upload to the Origin Server**
   - Content is first uploaded or hosted on the origin server (often the main application or web server). This includes web assets like HTML files, images, JavaScript, CSS, videos, and any other data required by the application.
   - The origin server is typically configured to work with the CDN provider, so content can be fetched or pre-loaded into the CDN.

### 2. **Content Request by the User**
   - When a user tries to access a website or application, their browser (or client) requests the content by accessing the URL.
   - The request includes a Domain Name System (DNS) query to locate the server hosting the content.

### 3. **DNS Resolution and Redirection to the CDN Edge Server**
   - The DNS query first directs the client to the CDN’s closest edge server. This redirection is managed by the CDN’s intelligent DNS, which uses the user’s location to select the nearest edge server.
   - The CDN edge server is often closer to the user geographically, reducing the latency associated with data travel over the internet.

### 4. **Checking for Cached Content on the Edge Server**
   - The CDN edge server checks its local cache for the requested content. 
   - If the content is already in the edge server’s cache (a **cache hit**), it’s served directly from the edge server to the user, leading to faster load times.
   - If the content is not in the cache (a **cache miss**), the edge server initiates a request to the origin server to retrieve the content.

### 5. **Fetching Content from the Origin Server (if Cache Miss)**
   - The CDN edge server forwards the request to the origin server for the specific content that’s missing.
   - The origin server responds with the requested content, which is then passed back to the edge server.
   - Once the edge server receives this content, it caches it for future requests to reduce the load on the origin server and speed up delivery for subsequent users.

### 6. **Content Delivery to the End User**
   - The edge server delivers the requested content to the end user.
   - For subsequent users in the same region requesting the same content, the edge server can directly serve it from its cache, eliminating the need to contact the origin server again.

### 7. **Content Expiry and Cache Refresh**
   - CDNs have cache expiration rules or **Time-To-Live (TTL)** settings for cached content. When the TTL expires, the cached content is invalidated, and the next user request will result in a cache miss, prompting the CDN to fetch fresh content from the origin server.
   - Content can also be updated immediately if the origin server pushes new content to the CDN or if cache purging is manually triggered.

### 8. **Dynamic Content Handling**
   - Not all content is static (e.g., user-specific data like a personalized dashboard). Dynamic content is often fetched directly from the origin server or generated in real-time, while the CDN caches static elements like images, videos, and CSS to improve speed.

### 9. **Analytics and Monitoring**
   - CDNs offer analytics and monitoring features, allowing content providers to track performance metrics, bandwidth usage, cache hit ratios, error rates, and geographic data.
   - These metrics help optimize content distribution, identify popular content, and further fine-tune caching strategies.

### Benefits of a CDN Workflow:
   - **Reduced Latency**: By serving content closer to users, CDNs decrease load times significantly.
   - **Scalability**: CDNs handle large volumes of requests efficiently, especially during traffic spikes.
   - **Reliability**: CDNs distribute requests across multiple servers, reducing the risk of overload on any single server.
   - **Bandwidth Savings**: CDNs cache content, reducing the bandwidth required from the origin server.

By following these steps, the CDN workflow ensures that content delivery is fast, reliable, and capable of handling significant demand across different geographic locations.
