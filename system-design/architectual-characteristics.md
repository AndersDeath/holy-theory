## Architectural characteristics

Architectural characteristics, also known as "quality attributes" or "non-functional requirements," describe how a software system should behave in terms of performance, scalability, usability, and maintainability, among other factors. They are critical in defining the overall quality of the software architecture and directly influence design decisions. Here’s an overview of key architectural characteristics:

### 1. **Performance**
   - **Definition**: Refers to how well the system responds to requests, often measured in terms of latency and throughput.
   - **Key Factors**: Response time, processing speed, and resource consumption.
   - **Example**: A system that handles a high volume of transactions per second with minimal delay.

### 2. **Scalability**
   - **Definition**: Describes the system’s ability to handle growth, whether it’s an increase in users, data, or workload.
   - **Key Factors**: Horizontal and vertical scalability, load balancing, and distributed architecture.
   - **Example**: An e-commerce platform that scales to accommodate increased traffic during peak shopping periods.

### 3. **Reliability**
   - **Definition**: Ensures the system performs its required functions under stated conditions for a specific period.
   - **Key Factors**: Fault tolerance, error handling, redundancy.
   - **Example**: A banking system that maintains uptime and accuracy in processing transactions even if some components fail.

### 4. **Availability**
   - **Definition**: Refers to the percentage of time the system is operational and accessible to users.
   - **Key Factors**: Redundancy, failover mechanisms, uptime.
   - **Example**: A system with a 99.99% uptime guarantees it’s available 24/7 with minimal downtime.

### 5. **Maintainability**
   - **Definition**: Measures how easily the system can be modified, fixed, or enhanced.
   - **Key Factors**: Modularity, simplicity, documentation quality.
   - **Example**: A modular application that allows individual components to be updated without affecting the whole system.

### 6. **Security**
   - **Definition**: The system’s ability to protect data and operations from unauthorized access and breaches.
   - **Key Factors**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, data protection.
   - **Example**: A secure web application that uses multi-factor authentication and data encryption to protect user information.

### 7. **Usability**
   - **Definition**: Reflects how easy and intuitive it is for users to interact with the system.
   - **Key Factors**: User experience (UX) design, accessibility, consistency.
   - **Example**: A website with a well-designed interface that users can navigate easily without extensive instructions.

### 8. **Portability**
   - **Definition**: Describes the ease with which the system or its components can be moved to other environments or platforms.
   - **Key Factors**: Platform independence, standardization, adaptability.
   - **Example**: A cloud-based application that can run on different cloud providers without major modifications.

### 9. **Interoperability**
   - **Definition**: The system’s ability to work with other systems or components, often through APIs.
   - **Key Factors**: Standard protocols, compatibility, data format support.
   - **Example**: A software application that integrates smoothly with other third-party services like payment gateways or social media platforms.

### 10. **Testability**
   - **Definition**: The ease with which the system can be tested to find defects and verify performance.
   - **Key Factors**: Modularity, test automation capability, code coverage.
   - **Example**: An application that allows automated testing of components, increasing confidence in releases.

### 11. **Modifiability**
   - **Definition**: How easily changes can be made to the software to adapt to new requirements or improvements.
   - **Key Factors**: Code structure, modular design, adherence to SOLID principles.
   - **Example**: A well-structured application that allows adding new features with minimal impact on existing functionality.

### 12. **Extensibility**
   - **Definition**: The system’s capacity to incorporate new functionality without altering its core architecture.
   - **Key Factors**: Plugin support, modular architecture.
   - **Example**: A content management system (CMS) that can add new plugins or modules without changing the core code.

### 13. **Reusability**
   - **Definition**: The system’s ability to use components or code across multiple applications or services.
   - **Key Factors**: Component independence, adherence to standard patterns.
   - **Example**: A reusable authentication module used across different applications within an organization.

These architectural characteristics shape the system's robustness, user experience, adaptability, and efficiency. They often involve trade-offs, and careful consideration is needed to balance them according to project requirements and goals.
