# Common Types of Attacks on Websites

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Description**: XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the web application to execute the script in the victim's browser.

**Impact**:
- Data theft
- Session hijacking
- Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

**Prevention**:
- Input validation and output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Regular security audits

## 2. SQL Injection (SQLi)
**Description**: SQL injection attacks involve inserting malicious SQL queries into input fields, which are then executed by the database. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or data manipulation.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized data access
- Data corruption or deletion
- Full control of the database server

**Prevention**:
- Parameterized queries
- Stored procedures
- Input validation

## 3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
**Description**: DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm a website or online service with a massive volume of traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact**:
- Website downtime
- Loss of revenue
- Damage to reputation

**Prevention**:
- Traffic analysis and filtering
- Rate limiting
- DDoS mitigation services

## 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Description**: CSRF attacks trick authenticated users into performing actions on a website without their consent. This is achieved by exploiting the user's active session with the web application.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized transactions
- Changes to account settings
- Data manipulation

**Prevention**:
- Anti-CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookie attribute
- Ensuring important actions require re-authentication

## 5. Brute Force Attacks
**Description**: Brute force attacks involve attempting to guess a user's password by systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized account access
- Data breaches
- Compromise of user credentials

**Prevention**:
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Strong password policies

## 6. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
**Description**: In MitM attacks, the attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.

**Impact**:
- Data interception
- Credential theft
- Unauthorized actions

**Prevention**:
- Use of HTTPS/TLS
- Secure network connections
- End-to-end encryption

## 7. Remote Code Execution (RCE)
**Description**: RCE attacks allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote server or system by exploiting vulnerabilities in the web application.

**Impact**:
- Full system compromise
- Data theft or destruction
- Service disruption

**Prevention**:
- Regular software updates and patches
- Input validation
- Use of security-focused coding practices

#### 8. Path Traversal
**Description**: Path traversal attacks involve manipulating file paths to access unauthorized files and directories on the web server.

**Impact**:
- Access to sensitive files
- Data leakage
- Potential for further exploitation

**Prevention**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Use of secure APIs for file access
- Least privilege principles

## 9. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
**Description**: IDOR vulnerabilities occur when an application exposes internal implementation objects, such as files, directories, or database keys, to the user.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized data access
- Data manipulation
- Breach of confidentiality

**Prevention**:
- Access control checks
- Use of indirect references
- Regular security testing

## 10. Clickjacking
**Description**: Clickjacking involves tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, leading to unintended actions.

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized actions
- Compromise of sensitive operations
- Data leakage

**Prevention**:
- X-Frame-Options header
- Frame-busting JavaScript
- Content Security Policy (CSP)

Understanding these common types of attacks on websites is crucial for building secure web applications. Implementing best practices for security, conducting regular audits, and staying informed about emerging threats can help protect websites from malicious actors.
