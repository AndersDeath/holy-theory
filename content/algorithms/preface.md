# Preface

This is start for preface draft.

Hello everybody. My name is Vladimir Bolshakov and I work in IT since 2005. During all past years I wrote code in different pogramming languages, huge variety of technologies. Besides the hands-on programming I fulfill different managing position. Of course like a lot of deveoplers and tech people in general I had to pass interviews when I decided to change position or job. For sure every time I had to do some preparations to interviews and recall a lot of coputer science theory. One of the most important topics that you should be ready to discuss on an interview - algorithms.
