# What is DORA metrics?

DORA originated as a team at Google Cloud specifically focused on assessing DevOps performance using a standard set of metrics. Their goal is to improve performance and collaboration while driving velocity. These metrics serve as a continuous improvement tool for DevOps teams everywhere by helping set goals based on current performance and then measuring progress against those goals.

DevOps is critical in keeping business software and processes running smoothly so users can focus on their work. DORA metrics are crucial in helping DevOps teams:

* Provide realistic response estimates
* Improve work planning
* Identify areas for improvement
* Build consensus for technical and resource investments

DORA metrics for DevOps teams focus on four critical measures:

* Frequency of deployments
* The amount of time between acceptance and deployment
* How frequently deployments fail
* How long it takes to restore serviceâ€”or recover from a failure
