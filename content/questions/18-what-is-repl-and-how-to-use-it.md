# What is REPL and how to use it?

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that allows you to enter commands or code snippets, evaluate them, and immediately see the results. REPLs are especially common in interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and also in compiled languages like Swift and TypeScript.

To use a REPL, you typically open a terminal or an online tool, enter your code, and observe the output instantly. This interactive nature makes it great for learning, testing small pieces of code, and exploring language features.

**Example in TypeScript:**

In TypeScript, you can utilize the TypeScript Playground, an online REPL environment provided by the TypeScript team.

1. **Access the TypeScript Playground:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to the TypeScript Playground at [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

2. **Write TypeScript Code:**
   In the left pane, you can write TypeScript code directly. For example:
   ```typescript
   function greet(name: string): string {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }

   const message: string = greet("TypeScript");
   console.log(message);
   ```
3. **Observe Compilation and Output:**
   As you type, the TypeScript Playground will compile your code in real-time. The compiled JavaScript code appears in the right pane. You can also see the output in the console at the bottom.

4. **Experiment and Learn:**
   You can experiment with different TypeScript features, explore type annotations, interfaces, classes, and more. Any errors or issues in your code will be highlighted, helping you learn and correct mistakes on the fly.

Remember that the TypeScript Playground provides a sandboxed environment to try out TypeScript without any local setup, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with the language.
