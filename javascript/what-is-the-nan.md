# What is the NaN

In JavaScript, `NaN` stands for "Not a Number." It is a special value representing an unrepresentable or undefined value resulting from operations that cannot produce a valid numeric result. For example, dividing zero by zero or trying to parse a string that does not represent a valid number results in `NaN`.

The concept of `NaN` in JavaScript can be traced back to the early versions of the language. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. `NaN` was introduced as a way to handle undefined or unrepresentable values in mathematical operations.

When a mathematical operation in JavaScript can't produce a meaningful numeric result, the value is set to `NaN`. For instance:

```javascript
var result = 0 / 0; // result is NaN because dividing zero by zero is undefined
```

It's important to note that `NaN` is not equal to itself according to JavaScript's specifications. This means that you cannot directly check if a value is `NaN` by using the equality operator (`==` or `===`). Instead, you should use the `isNaN()` function to determine whether a value is `NaN`:

```javascript
isNaN(NaN); // true
isNaN(10); // false
isNaN("Hello"); // true, because trying to convert "Hello" to a number results in NaN
```

The `isNaN()` function has been part of JavaScript since its early versions and provides a way to reliably check for `NaN` values.

In summary, `NaN` has been a fundamental concept in JavaScript since its inception, providing a way to handle undefined or unrepresentable values in numeric operations. The introduction of `NaN` has helped improve the reliability and consistency of numerical computations in JavaScript.
