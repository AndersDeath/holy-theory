</code></pre><p>The <code>canWinNim</code> function determines whether a player can win the game of Nim with a given number of stones (<code>n</code>) based on a specific rule. In the game of Nim, two players take turns removing stones from a pile. On each turn, a player can remove 1 to 3 stones. The player who removes the last stone wins the game.</p>
<p>The function&#39;s logic is based on the observation that if there are 4 stones left, the player whose turn it is will lose, no matter what move they make. This is because regardless of whether they remove 1, 2, or 3 stones, the other player can always take the remaining stones and win the game. Therefore, the function returns <code>false</code> for <code>n</code> divisible by 4, indicating that the current player cannot win the game.</p>
<p>For all other values of <code>n</code>, the function returns <code>true</code>, indicating that the current player can make a winning move and eventually force their opponent to be the one left with 4 stones, ensuring their victory.</p>
<p><strong>Techniques Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical Logic:</strong> The function employs a simple mathematical rule to determine whether the current player can win the game based on the number of stones (<code>n</code>) left.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>canWinNim</code> function provides an efficient way to determine the winning strategy for the game of Nim by leveraging a mathematical rule related to the number of stones remaining in a pile.</p>
