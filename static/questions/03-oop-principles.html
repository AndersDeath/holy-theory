<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>
<p>Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance. Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation. In a way, one class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it, just knowing the interfaces should be good enough.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritances expresses “is-a” and/or “has-a” relationship between two objects. Using Inheritance, In derived classes we can reuse the code of existing super classes. In Java, concept of “is-a” is based on class inheritance (using extends) or interface implementation (using implements).</p>
<h2 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h2>
<p>Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.</p>
<h2 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h2>
<p>It means one name many forms. It is further of two types — static and dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding. It is closely related to inheritance. We can write a code that works on the superclass, and it will work with any subclass type as well.</p>
