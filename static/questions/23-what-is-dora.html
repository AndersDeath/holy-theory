<p>DORA originated as a team at Google Cloud specifically focused on assessing DevOps performance using a standard set of metrics. Their goal is to improve performance and collaboration while driving velocity. These metrics serve as a continuous improvement tool for DevOps teams everywhere by helping set goals based on current performance and then measuring progress against those goals.</p>
<p>DevOps is critical in keeping business software and processes running smoothly so users can focus on their work. DORA metrics are crucial in helping DevOps teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide realistic response estimates</li>
<li>Improve work planning</li>
<li>Identify areas for improvement</li>
<li>Build consensus for technical and resource investments</li>
</ul>
<p>DORA metrics for DevOps teams focus on four critical measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency of deployments</li>
<li>The amount of time between acceptance and deployment</li>
<li>How frequently deployments fail</li>
<li>How long it takes to restore serviceâ€”or recover from a failure</li>
</ul>
