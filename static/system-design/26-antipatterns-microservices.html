<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersDeath/holy-theory/main/images/26-antipatterns-microservices.png" alt="Common anti-patterns in microservices architecture"></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Monolithic Mindset:</strong> Treating microservices as miniature monoliths, where services are tightly coupled and communicate extensively, negating the benefits of independent, autonomous services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chatty Communication:</strong> Excessive inter-service communication, leading to network congestion, increased latency, and reduced performance. Services should communicate judiciously to minimize network overhead.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Service Boundaries:</strong> Poorly defined or ambiguous service boundaries, resulting in overlapping responsibilities and difficulty in managing and scaling services independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Data Inconsistency:</strong> Sharing databases or data stores across multiple services without proper coordination, leading to data inconsistency, integrity issues, and coupling between services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Service Sprawl:</strong> Creating an excessive number of microservices without a clear reason or justification, resulting in complexity, operational overhead, and difficulty in managing and coordinating the services effectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Neglecting Operational Concerns:</strong> Ignoring operational aspects such as monitoring, logging, error handling, and deployment automation, which can hinder observability, maintainability, and reliability of the microservices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Poorly Defined Service Contracts:</strong> Lack of well-defined and stable service contracts or API specifications, making it difficult for consumers to integrate with the services and increasing the likelihood of breaking changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Inadequate Service Discovery:</strong> Relying on hard-coded service endpoints or manual configuration instead of implementing a robust service discovery mechanism, causing challenges in service deployment, scaling, and fault tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Distributed Data Management:</strong> Attempting to maintain strong consistency across multiple services, leading to complex distributed transactions and increased chances of failures and performance degradation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Neglecting Security:</strong> Failing to implement proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms, exposing services to security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Testing Strategies:</strong> Insufficient testing strategies for end-to-end integration testing, service contracts, fault tolerance, and failure scenarios, resulting in higher chances of undetected issues in the microservices ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insufficient Monitoring and Debugging:</strong> Inadequate monitoring and debugging capabilities across services, making it challenging to identify and troubleshoot issues promptly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Inconsistent Deployment and Release Management:</strong> Lack of standardized deployment processes and release management practices across services, leading to inconsistencies, deployment errors, and versioning issues.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Over-optimization:</strong> Premature optimization of individual microservices without considering the overall system performance and bottlenecks, leading to suboptimal performance at the system level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Governance and Documentation:</strong> Insufficient governance processes, documentation, and guidelines for designing, implementing, and evolving microservices, resulting in inconsistencies and difficulty in maintaining the architecture over time.</p>
</li>
