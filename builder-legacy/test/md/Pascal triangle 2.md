# Pascal triangle 2

```typescript
function generate(numRows: number): number[][] {
  const pascal: any = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
    pascal[i] = [];
    pascal[i][0] = 1;
    for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
      pascal[i][j] = pascal[i - 1][j - 1] + pascal[i - 1][j];
    }
    pascal[i][i] = 1;
  }

  return pascal;
}
```

The `generate` function generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows `numRows`. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each element at row `i` and column `j` is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row (`i-1`) at columns `j` and `j-1`.

Here's how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty array named `pascal` to hold the triangle's elements.

2. It iterates through each row from `0` to `numRows - 1` using a loop. For each row:
   - It initializes an empty array `pascal[i]` to hold the elements of the current row.
   - It sets the first element `pascal[i][0]` of the row to `1`.

3. For each row, starting from the second row (`i = 1`), it iterates through each column `j` from `1` to `i - 1`. For each column:
   - It calculates the current element `pascal[i][j]` by summing the elements from the previous row (`i-1`) at columns `j` and `j-1`.

4. After calculating the middle elements of the current row, it sets the last element `pascal[i][i]` of the row to `1`.

5. Finally, the function returns the `pascal` array, which now holds Pascal's Triangle up to the specified number of rows.

**Techniques Used:**

- **Nested Loops:** The function uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column of Pascal's Triangle.

- **Array Initialization and Manipulation:** The function initializes and manipulates arrays to store the elements of Pascal's Triangle.

- **Mathematical Logic:** The function uses mathematical logic to calculate binomial coefficients and generate Pascal's Triangle.

**Summary:**

The `generate` function generates Pascal's Triangle up to the specified number of rows by calculating binomial coefficients and organizing them into a triangular array. It employs nested loops and array manipulation techniques to achieve this.
