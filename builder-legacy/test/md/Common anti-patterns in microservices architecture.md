## Common anti-patterns in microservices architecture

![Common anti-patterns in microservices architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersDeath/holy-theory/main/images/26-antipatterns-microservices.png)

1. **Monolithic Mindset:** Treating microservices as miniature monoliths, where services are tightly coupled and communicate extensively, negating the benefits of independent, autonomous services.

2. **Chatty Communication:** Excessive inter-service communication, leading to network congestion, increased latency, and reduced performance. Services should communicate judiciously to minimize network overhead.

3. **Lack of Service Boundaries:** Poorly defined or ambiguous service boundaries, resulting in overlapping responsibilities and difficulty in managing and scaling services independently.

4. **Data Inconsistency:** Sharing databases or data stores across multiple services without proper coordination, leading to data inconsistency, integrity issues, and coupling between services.

5. **Service Sprawl:** Creating an excessive number of microservices without a clear reason or justification, resulting in complexity, operational overhead, and difficulty in managing and coordinating the services effectively.

6. **Neglecting Operational Concerns:** Ignoring operational aspects such as monitoring, logging, error handling, and deployment automation, which can hinder observability, maintainability, and reliability of the microservices.

7. **Poorly Defined Service Contracts:** Lack of well-defined and stable service contracts or API specifications, making it difficult for consumers to integrate with the services and increasing the likelihood of breaking changes.

8. **Inadequate Service Discovery:** Relying on hard-coded service endpoints or manual configuration instead of implementing a robust service discovery mechanism, causing challenges in service deployment, scaling, and fault tolerance.

9. **Distributed Data Management:** Attempting to maintain strong consistency across multiple services, leading to complex distributed transactions and increased chances of failures and performance degradation.

10. **Neglecting Security:** Failing to implement proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms, exposing services to security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

11. **Lack of Testing Strategies:** Insufficient testing strategies for end-to-end integration testing, service contracts, fault tolerance, and failure scenarios, resulting in higher chances of undetected issues in the microservices ecosystem.

12. **Insufficient Monitoring and Debugging:** Inadequate monitoring and debugging capabilities across services, making it challenging to identify and troubleshoot issues promptly.

13. **Inconsistent Deployment and Release Management:** Lack of standardized deployment processes and release management practices across services, leading to inconsistencies, deployment errors, and versioning issues.

14. **Over-optimization:** Premature optimization of individual microservices without considering the overall system performance and bottlenecks, leading to suboptimal performance at the system level.

15. **Lack of Governance and Documentation:** Insufficient governance processes, documentation, and guidelines for designing, implementing, and evolving microservices, resulting in inconsistencies and difficulty in maintaining the architecture over time.
