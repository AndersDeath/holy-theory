# MVC Pattern
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering to separate concerns within an application, making it more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. The pattern divides the application into three interconnected components:

### 1. **Model**
- **Definition**: Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Managing data and database interactions.
  - Implementing the core logic and rules of the application.
  - Notifying the view when data changes (in some implementations).
- **Example**: In a blog application, the Model would include classes like `Post`, `Comment`, `User`, and methods to retrieve, create, update, and delete these entities.

### 2. **View**
- **Definition**: Represents the user interface (UI) and presentation layer of the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Displaying data to the user.
  - Capturing user input and sending it to the Controller.
  - Updating the UI in response to changes in the Model.
- **Example**: In the same blog application, the View would include HTML templates, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior, such as rendering a list of blog posts or displaying a form to create a new post.

### 3. **Controller**
- **Definition**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handling user input and actions (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).
  - Interpreting user actions and updating the Model.
  - Deciding which View to render and passing the appropriate data to it.
- **Example**: In the blog application, the Controller would handle actions like creating a new post, editing an existing post, or deleting a comment. It would retrieve data from the Model, update the Model, and select the appropriate View to display the results.

### Interaction Flow
1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the View (e.g., by clicking a button or submitting a form).
2. **Controller Handling**: The Controller handles the user's action, processes the input, and interacts with the Model to update or retrieve data.
3. **Model Update**: The Model updates its state based on the Controller's instructions and may notify the View of any changes.
4. **View Update**: The View retrieves the updated data from the Model (directly or via the Controller) and refreshes the UI to reflect the changes.

### Benefits of MVC
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility, making the application easier to develop, test, and maintain.
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed and updated independently, facilitating parallel development and enhancing code reusability.
- **Scalability**: The clear separation of components allows the application to scale more easily, both in terms of functionality and development team size.
