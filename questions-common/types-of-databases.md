# Types of Databases

![Types of Databases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersDeath/holy-theory/main/images/05-types-of-databases.png)

Databases are categorized based on data structure, usage, and storage methods. Here are the main types of databases:

### 1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
   - **Definition**: Store data in structured tables with rows and columns, using SQL for queries.
   - **Key Features**: Strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, support for complex joins, and predefined schema.
   - **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

### 2. **NoSQL Databases**
   - **Definition**: Non-relational databases designed for unstructured, semi-structured, or large-scale data.
   - **Types of NoSQL Databases**:
      - **Document Databases**: Store data as documents, often in JSON format (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
      - **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
      - **Column-Family Stores**: Store data in columns instead of rows, often used in big data applications (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase).
      - **Graph Databases**: Use nodes and edges to represent and store data relationships (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).

### 3. **In-Memory Databases (IMDB)**
   - **Definition**: Store data primarily in main memory (RAM) instead of on disk, providing fast read and write performance.
   - **Key Features**: Ideal for applications requiring high-speed transactions and real-time data processing.
   - **Examples**: Redis, Memcached, SAP HANA.

### 4. **Object-Oriented Databases (OODB)**
   - **Definition**: Store data as objects, as in object-oriented programming, where objects can inherit attributes from other objects.
   - **Key Features**: Better suited for applications that work with complex data types.
   - **Examples**: ObjectDB, db4o, Versant.

### 5. **Graph Databases**
   - **Definition**: Use nodes and relationships (edges) to represent and store data, ideal for exploring complex relationships.
   - **Key Features**: Good for data with interconnected relationships, such as social networks or recommendation engines.
   - **Examples**: Neo4j, ArangoDB, Amazon Neptune.

### 6. **Time-Series Databases**
   - **Definition**: Designed to store and manage time-stamped or time-series data, typically for real-time analytics and monitoring.
   - **Key Features**: Optimized for querying data over specific time periods.
   - **Examples**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, OpenTSDB.

### 7. **Hierarchical Databases**
   - **Definition**: Store data in a tree-like structure where data is organized hierarchically, with a parent-child relationship.
   - **Key Features**: Good for applications with clear parent-child data relationships.
   - **Examples**: IBM Information Management System (IMS), Windows Registry.

### 8. **Network Databases**
   - **Definition**: Use a network structure, where multiple relationships can connect records, similar to a graph but with more complex schemas.
   - **Key Features**: Suitable for applications with interconnected data, but they can be complex to manage.
   - **Examples**: Integrated Data Store (IDS), CA-IDMS.

### 9. **Distributed Databases**
   - **Definition**: Store data across multiple servers or locations, appearing as a single database to users.
   - **Key Features**: Provides high availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability.
   - **Examples**: Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Cloud Spanner.

### 10. **Cloud Databases**
   - **Definition**: Hosted in the cloud, allowing users to access databases as a service without managing physical infrastructure.
   - **Key Features**: Scalable, flexible, with automated backup and maintenance.
   - **Examples**: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

### 11. **Columnar Databases**
   - **Definition**: Store data in columns rather than rows, optimizing for fast data retrieval in analytics and reporting.
   - **Key Features**: Ideal for large-scale analytical applications and data warehousing.
   - **Examples**: Apache Cassandra, Amazon Redshift, HBase.

### 12. **Multimodel Databases**
   - **Definition**: Support multiple data models (e.g., document, graph, key-value) in one system.
   - **Key Features**: Flexible for applications that require different data models.
   - **Examples**: ArangoDB, OrientDB, Cosmos DB.

Each database type has its own strengths, making it suitable for different types of applications and data requirements. Choosing the right database depends on the nature of the data, the intended use cases, and performance requirements.
