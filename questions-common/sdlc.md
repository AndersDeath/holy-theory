# Software development life cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software. It helps teams deliver high-quality software in a systematic and efficient way. Here’s an overview of the main SDLC phases:

### 1. **Planning**
   - **Purpose**: Define project goals, scope, budget, timeline, and resources.
   - **Activities**: Stakeholders identify project objectives, feasibility analysis, risk assessment, and resource allocation.
   - **Output**: A detailed project plan, budget, and timeline.

### 2. **Requirements Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Gather and document requirements from stakeholders to ensure the software meets their needs.
   - **Activities**: Interviewing users, understanding functional and non-functional requirements, and creating requirement specifications.
   - **Output**: Requirements Specification Document (often known as the SRS - Software Requirements Specification).

### 3. **Design**
   - **Purpose**: Create the architecture of the software based on requirements.
   - **Activities**: Designing system architecture, database design, defining the software’s components, modules, and interactions.
   - **Output**: System Design Document (SDD) detailing architecture, interface, and component designs.

### 4. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - **Purpose**: Convert the design into code.
   - **Activities**: Coding individual components, following best practices and coding standards, and unit testing for each module.
   - **Output**: Source code and initial code-level testing results.

### 5. **Testing**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure the software meets quality standards and functions as expected.
   - **Activities**: Performing different types of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance) to identify and fix defects.
   - **Output**: Tested software, Test Report, and bug fixes.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - **Purpose**: Release the software to the production environment for end-users.
   - **Activities**: Deploying code to production, user training, and setting up support channels.
   - **Output**: Live software and user feedback collection.

### 7. **Maintenance**
   - **Purpose**: Keep the software functional and up-to-date over time.
   - **Activities**: Fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance.
   - **Output**: Software updates, patches, and improvements.

### SDLC Models
There are several SDLC models, each with different approaches to handling these phases:

1. **Waterfall**: Sequential, moves in one direction.
2. **Agile**: Iterative, collaborative approach with sprints.
3. **Iterative**: Repeats phases to refine software gradually.
4. **V-Model**: Testing and development happen side-by-side.
5. **Spiral**: Combines iterative with risk assessment at each loop.

The SDLC ensures a systematic approach, improving project visibility, reducing risks, and helping teams deliver reliable software that meets user needs.
