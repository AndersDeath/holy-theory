# Git + Gitflow

**1. Purpose of Using GIT:**

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. Its main purposes are:

**a. Version Control:** Git helps developers manage and track different versions of their codebase, allowing for easy collaboration and tracking changes over time.

**b. Collaboration:** It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and reducing conflicts.

**c. History Tracking:** Git records every change made to the codebase, making it easy to trace back to specific changes, find bugs, and understand the evolution of the project.

**d. Branching and Merging:** Git allows developers to create branches for experimenting or developing new features without affecting the main codebase. Merging these branches back into the main codebase is seamless.

**e. Backup and Recovery:** Git provides redundancy and a backup mechanism for your code, reducing the risk of data loss.

**2. How Git Works:**

Git works based on the following core concepts:

**a. Repository:** A repository is where your project's files and their history are stored. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub or GitLab).

**b. Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of changes made to your code. Commits have unique identifiers and capture the state of your project at a specific moment.

**c. Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development. You can create branches to work on features or bug fixes independently. Branches help prevent conflicts when multiple people work on the same codebase.

**d. Merge:** Merging combines changes from one branch into another, typically integrating a feature branch back into the main codebase.

**e. Pull and Push:** Pulling retrieves changes from a remote repository to your local repository, while pushing sends your local changes to a remote repository.

**f. Remote:** A remote is a repository hosted on a server, like GitHub or GitLab, that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project.

**3. Gitflow:**

Gitflow is a branching model and workflow that defines a set of rules for managing branches in a Git repository. It was popularized by Vincent Driessen and helps teams organize their development process. It consists of the following main branches:

**a. Master (Main) Branch:** This branch contains production-ready code. It should always be stable and deployable.

**b. Develop Branch:** The develop branch is used for ongoing development. It's where new features and bug fixes are integrated before they reach the master branch.

**c. Feature Branches:** Feature branches are created for new features or enhancements. Each feature gets its own branch, allowing developers to work on features independently.

**d. Release Branches:** When it's time to prepare a new release, a release branch is created from the develop branch. Final testing and bug fixes are done here before merging into the master branch.

**e. Hotfix Branches:** Hotfix branches are used for critical bug fixes in the master branch. They are created from the master branch and merged back into both master and develop branches.

Gitflow provides a structured approach to managing code changes, ensuring a stable master branch while allowing for parallel development of new features and bug fixes. It enhances collaboration and coordination within development teams.
